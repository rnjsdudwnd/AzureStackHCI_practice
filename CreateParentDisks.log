WSLab Version v20.08.2

Lab telemetry
By providing a telemetry information you will help us to improve WSLab scripts. There are two levels of a telemetry information and we are not collecting any personally identifiable information (PII).
Details about telemetry levels and the content of telemetry messages can be found in documentation https://aka.ms/wslab/telemetry
Available telemetry levels are:
 * None  -- No information will be sent
 * Basic -- Lab info will be sent (e.g. script execution time, number of VMs)
 * Full  -- More details about the host machine and deployed VMs (e.g. guest OS)
Would you be OK with providing an information about your WSLab usage?

Tip: You can also configure telemetry settings explicitly in LabConfig.ps1 file or by setting an environmental variable and suppress this prompt.

Telemetry has been set to Basic level, thank you for your valuable feedback.
